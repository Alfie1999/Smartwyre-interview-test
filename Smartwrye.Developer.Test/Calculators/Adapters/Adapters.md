The adapter pattern can be a good fit for complying with SOLID principles, but there are considerations to ensure it adheres to each principle. Here’s how the `Adapter` classes in this example align with the SOLID principles:

### SOLID Principles Review

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   **Adapter Classes**:
   - Each adapter class (e.g., `AmountPerUomCalculatorAdapter`, `FixedCashAmountCalculatorAdapter`, and `FixedRateRebateCalculatorAdapter`) has a single responsibility: adapting a specific calculator to the `IRebateCalculator` interface.
   - **Compliant**: Each adapter focuses on converting calls from the interface it implements to the methods of the underlying calculator. 

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

   **Adapter Classes**:
   - The adapter classes are open for extension but closed for modification. You can extend functionality by adding new adapters without modifying existing ones.
   - **Compliant**: If you need to support a new type of calculator, you can create a new adapter without changing the existing adapters or the `IRebateCalculator` interface.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

   **Adapter Classes**:
   - Adapters should ensure that they can be used interchangeably with instances of `IRebateCalculator`. This means they should fulfill the contract of `IRebateCalculator` correctly.
   - **Compliant**: Each adapter provides implementations for `IsApplicable` and `CalculateRebateAmount` that align with the interface's expected behavior. Each adapter handles null values as needed and delegates correctly to the underlying calculator.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

   **Adapter Classes**:
   - The adapter should not force implementations to depend on methods they do not use. These adapters provide a way to adapt specific calculators to the `IRebateCalculator` interface without forcing unnecessary methods.
   - **Compliant**: The adapters only implement methods required by `IRebateCalculator` and delegate the work to the appropriate calculator.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

   **Adapter Classes**:
   - The `RebateService` depends on abstractions (i.e., `IRebateCalculator`) rather than concrete implementations of calculators. The adapters handle the specifics of converting between the different calculator implementations and the common interface.
   - **Compliant**: The `RebateService` is decoupled from the specific types of calculators, relying on the `IRebateCalculator` abstraction. The adapters act as intermediaries that ensure correct interaction between the service and various calculator implementations.


### Summary

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each adapter class has one reason to change: if the interface or implementation of a specific calculator changes.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The system is open for extension (new adapters) but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Adapters conform to the `IRebateCalculator` interface, allowing for interchangeable use.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Adapters implement only the methods they need.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: The high-level module (`RebateService`) depends on abstractions (`IRebateCalculator`), not on concrete implementations.

By adhering to these principles, the code will be more modular, extensible, and maintainable.
