Here's the break down the `SimpleRebateCalculatorFactory` or the `simplier factory class` and understand its components and functionality.

### `RebateCalculatorFactory` Class

#### Purpose
The `RebateCalculatorFactory` class is a factory that creates and manages instances of different types of rebate calculators. It utilizes a dictionary to map `RebateCalculatorType` values to their corresponding `IRebateCalculator` implementations. This design allows you to retrieve the appropriate calculator based on the type of rebate you are processing.

#### Components

1. **Private Dictionary Field:**

   ```csharp
   private readonly Dictionary<RebateCalculatorType, IRebateCalculator> _calculators;
   ```

   This dictionary stores mappings from `RebateCalculatorType` to `IRebateCalculator`. It enables efficient lookup of the appropriate calculator based on the rebate type.

2. **Constructor:**

   ```csharp
   public RebateCalculatorFactory()
   {
       _calculators = new Dictionary<RebateCalculatorType, IRebateCalculator>
       {
           { RebateCalculatorType.FixedCashAmount, new FixedCashAmountCalculatorAdapter(new FixedCashAmountCalculator()) },
           { RebateCalculatorType.FixedRate, new FixedRateRebateCalculatorAdapter(new FixedRateRebateCalculator()) },
           { RebateCalculatorType.AmountPerUom, new AmountPerUomCalculatorAdapter(new AmountPerUomCalculator()) }
           // Add more calculators as needed
       };
   }
   ```

   - **Initialisation:** The constructor initialises the `_calculators` dictionary with mappings of `RebateCalculatorType` values to instances of `IRebateCalculator`.
   - **Adapters:** Each entry in the dictionary uses an adapter (`FixedCashAmountCalculatorAdapter`, `FixedRateRebateCalculatorAdapter`, `AmountPerUomCalculatorAdapter`) to wrap the corresponding concrete calculator (`FixedCashAmountCalculator`, `FixedRateRebateCalculator`, `AmountPerUomCalculator`). This allows for flexible integration with different types of calculators while adhering to the `IRebateCalculator` interface.

3. **Method: `GetCalculator`**

   ```csharp
   public IRebateCalculator GetCalculator(Rebate rebate)
   {
       // Attempt to get the calculator based on the rebate type
       if (_calculators.TryGetValue(rebate.RebateCalculatorType, out var calculator))
       {
           return calculator;
       }

       // If no matching calculator is found, throw an exception
       throw new InvalidOperationException($"No calculator found for rebate type {rebate.RebateCalculatorType}.");
   }
   ```

   - **Purpose:** This method retrieves the appropriate `IRebateCalculator` based on the `RebateCalculatorType` property of the provided `Rebate` object.
   - **Lookup:** It uses the `TryGetValue` method to check if there is a corresponding calculator for the given rebate type in the `_calculators` dictionary.
   - **Exception Handling:** If no matching calculator is found, it throws an `InvalidOperationException` with a message indicating that no calculator is available for the specified rebate type.

### Summary

- **Dictionary-Based Lookup:** The factory uses a dictionary to map rebate types to their respective calculators, which provides a fast and efficient way to retrieve the appropriate calculator based on the rebate type.
- **Adapters:** The factory uses adapters to wrap concrete calculator implementations, allowing for flexibility and integration with different types of calculators.
- **Error Handling:** The `GetCalculator` method includes error handling to manage cases where a requested rebate type does not have a corresponding calculator.

This approach ensures that the creation and retrieval of rebate calculators are centralized, making the system easier to maintain and extend. If new types of rebates or calculators need to be added, you only need to update the dictionary initialisation in the factory.
